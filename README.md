# Face Verification

This project aims to identify people in videos with deep learning methods. 
The initial idea was to replicate the [VGG2 Dataset paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.08092), therefore I have trained a ResNet-50 model for that purpose on a subset of that dataset. 
Since the focus was in the identification of a person by their face, the component regarding the detection of faces is a pretrained [TinyFaces Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04402) using the weights given in this [tiny-faces-pytorch repository](https://github.com/varunagrawal/tiny-faces-pytorch).
